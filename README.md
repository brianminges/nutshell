# Ghost Zen Den: The Information Dashboard
An app to organize daily tasks, events, news article, friends and chat messages.

## General information
This is a group React project as part of a software development bootcamp at Nashville Software School. My contributions were navigation bar, articles components and css. Other contributors: [rjsdev2013](https://github.com/rjsdev2013), [madison-hepner](https://github.com/madison-hepner), [RKBGK](https://github.com/RKBGK). The sign-in code was provided by instructors at NSS. Authentication is not an objective of the class, and this is meant only to allow for multiple users. It is not secure, and is not meant to be.

## Technologies
- React v.17
- ES6
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JSON-server

## Features
- Full CRUD capabilities.
- Sign in allows for multiple, distinct users and profiles.
- Users can add articles that link to source material, tasks and events.
